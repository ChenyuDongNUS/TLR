# Time-Lagged Recurrences (TLR, $\alpha_\eta$)

Python code and Jupyter notebooks support the manuscript "Revisiting the Predictability of Dynamical Systems: A New Local Data-Driven Approach," which introduces the Time-Lagged Recurrences (TLR) as a novel predictability index.

## Introduction

### Scripts

Functions for computing TLR ($\alpha_\eta$), along with the other two local dynamical indices: local dimension $d$ and persistence $\Theta$.
